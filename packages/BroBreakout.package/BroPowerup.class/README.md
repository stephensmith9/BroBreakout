A BroPowerup is a hidden bonus (sometimes good, sometimes bad) that appears after colldiing with a certain block.

The current powerups available are:

Accelerate - makes the ball travel faster
Ball - adds a new ball to the world
Decelerate - slows down the ball
Enlarge - makes the rackets larger
Shrink - makes the rackets smaller

A BroPowerup is an abstract subclass of CircleMorph which provides basic functionality (like collision detection) and defines methods which have to be overridden by subclasses (execute and imageName).
